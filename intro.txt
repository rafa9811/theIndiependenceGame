30	20	Tomorrow is an important day.
30	20	It's YOUR important day.
30	20	Today is 30th September, in 2017. You know what I'm talking about.
30	20	YOUR people will decide tomorrow.
30	20	. . .
30	20	It's 'YOUR PEOPLE', because it's YOU!
30	20	Carles Puidgemont! Why have you forgotten who you are?
30	20	Today you received an anonymous call...
30	20	Someone behind the unknown name of M.Rajoy, told you that all of your ballot boxes and ballots have been destroyed or lost. "You won't make Catalonia independent!" he said.
30	20	But little did they know that in just a day you are able to prepare by yourself all the referendum.
30	20	You now have to rush to Bar√ßalona and collect all the ballot boxes, as well as turn on the printers for having ballots to introduce, of course.
30	20	But be careful! The civil guard knows that you will be there preparing everything, so you have to sow chaos in the city so as to have them distracted by the disturbs (or else you will lose!). You've got some meetings to do then...
30	20	Last, talk with everyone. The people from Catalonia won't win if they don't have the chance to help you with their knowings.
30	20	With that, good luck President! Remember to press return to start, as well as Q to quit at anytime!
